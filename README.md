# QUANTUM LANGUAGE 🔐⚡

### _Because Python was too easy and C++ wasn't painful enough_

## What Is This?

Quantum is a **dynamically-typed scripting language** built from scratch in C++17 by someone who clearly had too much free time and not enough therapy.

It uses the `.sa` file extension. We don't know what `.sa` stands for. **Saad Amin**? **Slightly Ambitious**? **Suspiciously Ambitious**? The world may never know.

You run it like this:

```
quantum script.sa
```

One command. Very cool. Very hacker. Much wow.

---

## Why Does This Exist?

Excellent question. Python exists. JavaScript exists. Bash exists. Rust exists. But apparently none of them were _cybersecurity-ready_ enough, so Saad said:

> _"You know what the world needs? Another scripting language. But this one has `rot13`."_

And thus, Quantum was born.

## ✨ "Features"

| Feature                   | What They Said                                 | What It Means                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔀 Multi-syntax           | "Python, JS, and C++ syntax work side by side" | The parser is just vibing                                        |
| 🧠 Dynamic Typing         | "No type declarations needed"                  | Types are just suggestions anyway                                |
| 🌳 Tree-walk Interpreter  | "Clean, hackable engine"                       | It's slow but it's _artisanal_                                   |
| 💻 REPL Mode              | "Interactive shell"                            | For when you want to feel like a hacker but only have 10 minutes |
| 🔐 Cybersecurity Builtins | "`xor_bytes`, `rot13`"                         | ROT13. In 2026. Peak security.                                   |
| 🎯 First-class Functions  | "Closures, lambdas, arrow functions"           | Basically just stole JS's homework                               |
| 🏛️ OOP                    | "Classes with inheritance"                     | Because of course it has classes                                 |

## The Cybersecurity "Roadmap" 🗺️

The README lists these as **reserved keywords for upcoming features**:

- `scan` — _Network scanning_ (totally legal, we promise)
- `payload` — _"Exploit payload construction"_ (sir this is a GitHub repo)
- `encrypt` / `decrypt` — AES, RSA (coming soon™)
- `hash` — MD5, SHA-256 (MD5 in 2026 👀)

To be fair, `rot13` is already implemented, so the NSA is shaking.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Step 1: Question your life choices
git clone https://github.com/SENODROOM/Quantum-Language.git

# Step 2: Build it (pray to CMake gods)
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release

# Step 3: Write your first script
echo 'print("Hello from Quantum!")' > hello.sa

# Step 4: Run it and feel like a hacker
quantum hello.sa
# → Hello from Quantum!

# Step 5: Realize Python would've taken 3 seconds
```

## Sample Code: XOR Encryption

```quantum
fn xor_encrypt(text, key):
    return xor_bytes(text, key)

message   = "Hello, Quantum!"
key       = "secret"
encrypted = xor_encrypt(message, key)
decrypted = xor_encrypt(encrypted, key)

print("Encrypted:", to_hex(encrypted))
print("Decrypted:", decrypted)
```

> XOR encryption. The cryptographic equivalent of a bike lock. But hey, it's _built-in_, so that's something.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: It has 0 stars on GitHub. You decide.

**Q: Should I use this for real cybersecurity work?**
A: Please don't.

**Q: Why `.sa` extension?**
A: We asked. Saad didn't respond. We assume it's classified.

**Q: Is `rot13` really a cybersecurity feature?**
A: Julius Caesar used it. He was eventually stabbed by his friends, but that's unrelated.

**Q: Will `payload` keyword actually help me build exploits?**
A: It will help GitHub flag your repo.

## CLI Reference

```
quantum <file.sa>          Run a Quantum script (and feel powerful)
quantum                    Start REPL (pretend you're in Mr. Robot)
quantum --check <file.sa>  Check syntax (it won't pass, but nice try)
quantum --version          Confirm you installed this
quantum --help             Admit you're lost
quantum --aura             ??? (We're scared to run this)
```

## Competitor Analysis 📊

Let's see how Quantum stacks up against the competition:

| Language    | Created By       | Years in Development | Stars    | Has `rot13` |
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Python      | Guido van Rossum | 4 years              | 60k+     | No          |
| JavaScript  | Brendan Eich     | 10 days              | Universe | No          |

## Error Messages You Will Definitely See

```
QuantumError: Unexpected token at line 1
  → You typed something

QuantumError: Undefined variable 'x'
  → You forgot dynamic typing doesn't mean magic

QuantumError: Stack overflow in recursive function
  → The irony of a language named Quantum having classical problems

QuantumError: Cannot XOR a string with your disappointment
  → Personal attack from the interpreter

QuantumError: rot13 applied twice returns original string
  → This is a feature, not a bug. This is literally how rot13 works.
```

## The `.sa` Extension: A Deep Investigation 🕵️

We have spent considerable time researching what `.sa` stands for. Our findings:

- **S**aad **A**min ← most likely
- **S**cripting **A**bomination ← unfair but considered
- **S**omewhat **A**mbiguous ← accurate
- **S**till **A**nother language extension ← we checked, `.py`, `.js`, `.rb`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.lua` were all taken
- **S**ecret **A**genda ← given the `payload` keyword, plausible
- **S**yntax **A**narchy ← Python + JS + C++ in one file suggests yes

**Official conclusion:** Unknown. Classified. `.sa`.

## Performance Benchmarks 🏎️

We ran Quantum against Python on a fibonacci(35) test:

```
Python 3.12:     1.2 seconds
Quantum v1.0.0:  [still running]
Node.js:         0.4 seconds
Quantum v1.0.0:  [still running]
Rust:            0.002 seconds
Quantum v1.0.0:  [still running]
```

_Tree-walk interpreters are known for their warmth, character, and charm. Speed is for people without personality._

---

## Security Advisory ⚠️

The following Quantum code has been flagged as a potential threat:

```quantum
message = "Hello World"
print(rot13(message))
# Output: "Uryyb Jbeyq"
# Status: ENCRYPTED. Unbreakable. Do not share.
```

If you receive a message encoded with Quantum's `rot13`, please apply `rot13` again to decrypt it. This is the entire security model.

**CVE Status:** None filed yet. Give it time.

---

## Comparison: Writing Hello World

**In Python:**

```python
print("Hello World")
```

**In Quantum:**

```quantum
print("Hello World")
```

**Identical.** This raises the question of what exactly was built here, but we respect the hustle.

---

## What The `--aura` Flag Actually Does

Nobody knows. The README mentions it shows a "project achievement board." We ran it. We saw things. We don't talk about it.

What we _can_ say is that it's the only CLI flag in any programming language runtime that references **vibes** as a metric. For that alone, Quantum deserves to exist.

---

## Conclusion

Look — Quantum is actually impressive. Writing a scripting language from scratch in C++17 with a lexer, parser, tree-walk interpreter, REPL, OOP, closures, AND cybersecurity builtins is genuinely a lot of work. Most people can't do this.

Saad built it anyway.

Is it going to replace Python? No.
Is it going to replace Bash? Absolutely not.
Is `rot13` a serious cryptographic tool? I cannot stress this enough — no.

But did one person build an entire programming language from scratch and ship v1.0.0?

**Yes. Yes they did.**

Mad respect. 🫡

## License

MIT — meaning you can use this to do anything, including things that would make Saad regret open-sourcing it.

_Built with love, C++17, and an alarming disregard for the existence of Python._

**⚡ Quantum — Write once, run anywhere, hack everything (responsibly, please).**
